# Clicky Game
The objective of the game is to click on every card only once. Every time a user clicks a card, if that card has not already been clicked during the round, their score is incremented by one, and the card positions are shuffled. If the card has already been clicked during that round, their score is reset to 0 and a new round begins. The player has completely won the game if they reach a score of 16, as there are 16 cards to click on.
